# Section 20:  Introduction Function
 Introduction Function

# What I Learned
- You should always define function before you use them
    - Before you get used to hoisting
- `fuction greet(first, last)`
    - `greet(1,2)` or `greet(2,1)`
        - Order matters
- To get first letter from lastName `lastName[0]`
- function scope
    - Old way of declaring variable is using `var`
        - They are scoped to functions, but not to blocks
        - let and const were inroduced for this problematic reason of scopes
        - dont use `var`
