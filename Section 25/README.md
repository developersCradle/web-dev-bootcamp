 The Missing Piece: DOM Events

# What I Learned

- Different types of events
- **Three** main ways to add event
    - Adding Js code direnct to HTML element
        - Inline Event Handlers
        - Not preferred
        ```
        <button onclick="alert('you clicked me!'); alert('stop clicking')">Click Me!</button>
        ```
        - Hard to code many lines
        - Hard to but same behaviour to another button, need to copy same code
