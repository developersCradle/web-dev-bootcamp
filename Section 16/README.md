JavaScript Decision Making


# What I Learned
- [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf)
- Comparisons chracters are using unicode values
- `==` value comperisons
- `1 == '1'` first conversion is made after that coprisong is made 
- `===` strict equal, does not make conversions
	- always use `===` if need equality
