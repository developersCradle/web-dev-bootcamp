## Section 7: The World of CSS Selectos

# What I Learned

- There is many different selectors


- **Universal Selector**, selects all
    - Not very common
```
* {
    color: black;
}
```

- **Element Selector**, selects all spesifed img elements
    - Very common
```
img {
    widyh: 100px;
    height: 200px;
}
```


- **Selector list**, selects both h1 and h2, seperated by comma

- **ID selector**

- Id usefull to spesify unique element
    - Id selectors should keep minumum as possible, there is better selectors, but these are good nonetheless
