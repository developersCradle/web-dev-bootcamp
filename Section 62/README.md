Local React Apps With Vite

# What I Learned

- One way which we are running our app locally is using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - French world for "rapid" deployment

  - Using **npm** to install Vite follows the instructions provided by install app
  such ass `npm create vite@latest`

- **Create react app** is similar to **vite**, but its specific to **react**

- Its more traditional to use **Create react app** 

- Our React app gets inserted into `<div id="root"></div>`

- Vite is also good, comes with dev server, coverts our JSX to JS, sets up babel, does a lot of work for us.
