- Missing key in list from each child element
    - In **React** world needs key for every element to keep track of every element 

- List can **survive** whiteout keys, but when they get modified or re-ordered, things get problematic 
    - We can add **hard coded** id into data, since we can assume that this data coming from database has this kind of **UID**

```
const data = [
    { id : 1, item : "eggs", quantity : 12, completed : false },
    { id : 2, item : "milk", quantity : 1, completed : true },
    { id : 3, item : 'chicken', quantity : 4, completed : false },
    { id : 4, item : 'carrots', quantity : 6, completed : true },
];
```

- And add this to looping function when iterating over this list of data. Usage of react **key** prop

```
  {items.map((i) => (
            <li key={i.id} 
            style={{
                color: i.completed ? "gray" : "red",
                textDecoration : i.completed ? "line-through" : "none",
            }}
        >
            {i.item} - {i.quantity}
        </li>
```

- 1. Even **AirBnb** has unique key prop in baked in to their system

- In **React** you should make many small components rather than one big one. Reason is usability

- You should get used to thinking to abstract logic into smaller pieces. For example if **delete button** would get introduced it should be in separate class file

> The key prop in React is special and is used by React's diffing algorithm for performance optimization. It's not meant to be used as a normal prop, and it won't be passed down to the component. Therefore, when we de-structure the props in the ShoppingListItem component, the key prop is not included because it's not part of the props object that's passed into the component.

```
   <ShoppingListItem
            key={i.id}
            item = {i.item}
            quantity = {i.quantity}
            completed = {i.completed}
            />
```

- We can use spread operator in this case names matches in receiving side 
    - Names needs to **match**
    - Using spread operator is pretty common in **React**

```
function ShoppingListItem({item, quantity, completed}) {
```

```
import ShoppingListItem from "./ShoppingListItem";



function ShoppingList({items}) {
return (
    <ul>
        {
        items.map((i) => (
           <ShoppingListItem
            
           key={i.id}
            {...i}

            />
        ))}
    </ul>
    );   
}

export default ShoppingList;
```

- **PropTypes** is not popular anymore, for eslint since ts is come along
    - PropTypes are not bad, just slowing our course down
    - PropType is just to tell prop what type it is
- [ ] if needed get know to PropTypes Library Course
